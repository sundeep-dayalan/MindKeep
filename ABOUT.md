#### **What are Personas?**

A persona is a customized AI mode with:

- **Context**: Instructions that shape AI behavior
- **Output Template**: Consistent formatting for responses
- **Search-Only Mode**: Personas can only read notes, not create/modify them

#### **Built-in Personas**

##### **1. Email Writer Persona**

- **Purpose**: Craft professional emails
- **Context**: "You're a professional email assistant..."
- **Best For**: Business correspondence, formal communications

##### **2. Code Helper Persona**

- **Purpose**: Assist with programming tasks
- **Context**: "You're a technical coding assistant..."
- **Best For**: Code snippets, debugging, documentation

##### **3. Meeting Brief Persona**

- **Purpose**: Summarize meetings and create action items
- **Context**: "You're a meeting summarization assistant..."
- **Best For**: Meeting notes, action items, summaries

#### **Using Personas**

1. **Activate a Persona**:

   - Click the **Personas button** (üë§) in the head AI chat
   - Select a persona from the list
   - Active persona shows with a checkmark

2. **See Persona Indicator**:

### üìã Context Menu Integration

Save web content to MindKeep with a right-click!

#### **How to Use**

1. **Select text** on any webpage
2. **Right-click** the selection
3. **Choose "Save to MindKeep"** from the menu
4. **Side panel opens** with selected content pre-filled
5. **Content preserves formatting** (HTML is converted to rich text)
6. **Source URL is automatically saved**

#### **What Gets Saved**

- ‚úÖ **Text formatting**: Bold, italic, underline, colors
- ‚úÖ **Links**: Hyperlinks are preserved
- ‚úÖ **Structure**: Headings, lists, blockquotes
- ‚úÖ **Source URL**: For reference back to original page

---

### Semantic Search

MindKeep's search goes beyond keyword matching.

#### **How Semantic Search Works**

Traditional search finds exact word matches:

```
Query: "login credentials"
Finds: Notes containing "login" AND "credentials"
Misses: Notes with "username and password", "access keys", "auth tokens"
```

Semantic search understands meaning:

```
Query: "login credentials"
Finds:
  ‚úÖ "Netflix username and password"
  ‚úÖ "AWS access keys"
  ‚úÖ "Database authentication tokens"
  ‚úÖ "SSH private key for server"
```

#### **Embedding-Based Search**

1. **Note Creation**: Each note is converted to a 384-dimensional vector (embedding)
2. **Query Processing**: Your question is converted to the same vector space
3. **Similarity Matching**: Finds notes with vectors closest to query vector
4. **Ranked Results**: Returns most relevant notes first

#### **Search Tips**

‚ú® **Ask naturally**: "How do I deploy to production?" works better than "deploy production"
‚ú® **Use context**: "What was discussed in yesterday's meeting?" vs "meeting notes"
‚ú® **Be specific**: "Netflix login" vs "password"
‚ú® **Conversational follow-ups**: "What about the AWS account?" after "What's my Netflix password?"

---

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### **Q: Is my data really private?**

**A:** Yes! 100% of your data stays in your browser. Gemini Nano runs locally, and there are zero external API calls. Your notes are encrypted and stored only in IndexedDB on your device.

---

### **Q: What happens if I clear browser data?**

**A:** Clearing Chrome's storage will delete all your notes. MindKeep uses IndexedDB, which is cleared when you wipe browser data. Always back up important notes outside the browser if needed.

---

### **Q: Why is the AI download so large?**

**A:** Gemini Nano is a sophisticated language model (1-2GB). This one-time download enables all local AI features without ever needing internet again.

---

### **Q: Can I use MindKeep on other browsers?**

**A:** Currently, MindKeep only works on **Google Chrome** because Gemini Nano is a Chrome-exclusive feature. Edge, Firefox, and Safari don't support it yet.

---

### **Q: What if AI says "not available"?**

**A:** Ensure you've:

1. Enabled required Chrome flags (`chrome://flags`)
2. Restarted Chrome after enabling flags
3. Allowed model download to complete (check AI Status Banner)
4. Updated Chrome to version 127 or later

---

### **Q: Can I export my notes?**

**A:** Currently, there's no built-in export feature. Notes are stored in IndexedDB. Future versions may include export functionality.

---

### **Q: How does category suggestion work?**

**A:** When typing in the editor, MindKeep analyzes your content with Gemini Nano and suggests relevant existing categories plus new ones based on content theme.

---

### **Q: Can I search by date?**

**A:** Not directly through the UI yet. However, you can ask the AI: "Show me notes from last week" or "What did I save yesterday?"

---

### **Q: What's the note size limit?**

**A:** There's no hard limit, but extremely large notes (>100KB) may slow down embedding generation. Break large content into multiple notes for better performance.

---

### **Q: Does MindKeep work offline?**

**A:** Yes! After the initial Gemini Nano download, MindKeep works 100% offline. All AI features function without internet.

---

### **Q: Can multiple people share notes?**

**A:** No. MindKeep is designed for personal use. Each browser instance has its own isolated data store.

---

### **Q: What about browser sync?**

**A:** Chrome Sync doesn't sync IndexedDB data by design. Your notes stay on each device. This is intentional for privacy.

---

### **Q: How do I delete all notes?**

**A:** Open Chrome DevTools (F12) ‚Üí Console ‚Üí Run:

```javascript
chrome.storage.local.clear()
indexedDB.deleteDatabase("mindkeep_db")
```

Then restart the extension.

---

### **Q: Can I customize the AI's personality?**

**A:** Yes! Create custom personas with specific instructions in the "Context" field. The AI will follow those guidelines when the persona is active.

---

### **Q: What languages does MindKeep support?**

**A:** Gemini Nano supports multiple languages, but MindKeep's UI is currently English-only. However, you can save notes in any language.

---

### **Q: Is there a mobile version?**

**A:** No. Chrome extensions are desktop-only. Mobile support isn't technically possible with current Chrome APIs.

---

### **Q: How do I report bugs?**

**A:** Visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/your-repo/mind-keep) (if available) or contact the developer.

---

### **Q: Will my notes be compatible with future versions?**

**A:** Yes. The database schema is versioned, and migrations are handled automatically to ensure compatibility.
